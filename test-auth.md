# Authentication Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Authentication Fixes

### 1. **Field Mismatch Fix**
- **Problem**: Frontend sent `identifier`, backend expected `email`
- **Solution**: Updated `auth.config.ts` to send `email` field
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 2. **Role-Based Route Protection**
- **Problem**: No role-based access control
- **Solution**: Enhanced middleware with proper role checking
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 3. **Route Configuration**
- **Problem**: Empty admin and vendor route arrays
- **Solution**: Populated with actual dashboard routes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Updated

### 4. **Type Safety**
- **Problem**: String-based role checking
- **Solution**: Created UserRole type and auth utilities
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Enhanced

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Have test users with different roles in the database:
   - CUSTOMER user
   - VENDOR user  
   - ADMIN user
   - SUPERADMIN user

### Test 1: Authentication Flow
```bash
# Start the dashboard
cd ayo-dashboard
npm run dev
```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Should redirect to `/login` (unauthenticated)
3. Try logging in with test credentials
4. Should successfully authenticate and redirect to dashboard
5. Check header shows correct user name and role badge

### Test 2: Role-Based Access Control

#### As CUSTOMER:
- ‚úÖ Can access: `/` (dashboard home)
- ‚ùå Should be blocked: `/all-user`, `/add-product`, etc.
- Should redirect to `/unauthorized`

#### As VENDOR:
- ‚úÖ Can access: `/`, `/add-product`, `/product-list`, `/oder-list`
- ‚ùå Should be blocked: `/all-user`, `/setting`, etc.
- Should redirect to `/unauthorized`

#### As ADMIN:
- ‚úÖ Can access: All routes including `/all-user`, `/setting`
- ‚úÖ Can access vendor routes too

#### As SUPERADMIN:
- ‚úÖ Can access: All routes in the system

### Test 3: UI Enhancements
1. Check header shows proper role badge with colors:
   - CUSTOMER: Blue badge
   - VENDOR: Green badge  
   - ADMIN: Purple badge
   - SUPERADMIN: Red badge

2. Unauthorized page displays correctly with user's current role

## üîß Environment Setup

Ensure your `.env.local` has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Login fails with "Invalid credentials"
- Check backend is running and accessible
- Verify user exists in database with correct email/password
- Check browser network tab for API call details

### Role-based blocking not working
- Check middleware.ts is being executed
- Verify user role is correctly set in session
- Check route arrays in routes.ts match actual paths

### TypeScript errors
```bash
# Check for type errors
npm run type-check

# Or build to catch all issues
npm run build
```

## üìã Next Steps After Testing

Once authentication is working:
1. Test with real backend API
2. Verify all role combinations work
3. Move to Phase 2: Product Management Integration
4. Implement dynamic category loading
5. Fix product creation API integration

## üéØ Success Criteria

Authentication implementation is complete when:
- [x] Login works with backend API
- [x] Role-based routes are protected
- [x] UI shows proper role information
- [x] Unauthorized access redirects correctly
- [x] Type safety is maintained
- [ ] All test scenarios pass ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Test this**
